*  Description of the file "Final Project"
*******************************************************

The goal of the final project is to build our own ray tracer taking guidance from various sources such as a book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" where it depicts on how to build a simple ray tracer with little time. The main goal of the project is to extend the working ray tracing code to first add support for the triangle meshes. This is to be loaded from the OBJ loader to create a custom scene. The next part of the project is to provide descriptions of current approaches and how machine learning have contributed to improve real-time ray tracing. The ray tracer created by us should be optimized in a way.

*  Source files
*******************************************************

The whole project is delivered in a folder named "Final project". Inside the folder, the main files present are

1. main.cc - Main file in which all the code is dependent on.

2. Animation - Video of animated objects

3. Header Files - Header files provide a way into the main.cc file for executing.

4. TriangleObj - It is a triangle object loaded from OBJ loader.

5. Documentation - Documentation file containing report and results present in the instructions of the final project. 

6. Ray tracer optimized - Source code for optimized ray tracer. 

7. Image - Ray Tracer Image optimized. 

8. Library files - Files necessary for running of the program.

*  How to run the code and obtain results.
*******************************************************

1. Unzip and extract all the files into a directory.

2. Install Microsoft visual studio if not already installed. Open the Microsoft visual studio and select "create a new project".

3. Create an empty project. 

4. In the solution explorer right click and select add -> Existing items -> Select all the items to load into the Microsoft visual studio.

5. From the solution explorer, select main.cc file. Double click on it to open.

6. Build the program. The output of the image when it is run is saved in the desiring directory.

7. The optimized version of ray tracer has just the source code. When it is run, the desired result is shown. 

8. All the results are clearly explained in the results document.
